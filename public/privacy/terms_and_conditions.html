              non-transferable, non-exclusive license (without the right to
              sublicense) to use the Website and the Service exclusively for
              your personal, non-commercial use. <br />4.6. You agree,
              represent, and warrant that your use of the Service, or any part
              thereof, will comply with the aforementioned license, covenants,
              and restrictions and will not infringe or violate the rights of

              are not under the Company's control, and the Company is not

              Third Party Ads only as a convenience and does not review,
              approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations
              with respect to Third Party Ads. Advertisements and other
              information provided by Third Party Sites Ads may not be wholly
              accurate. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all
              risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources. When
              you link to a third-party site, the applicable service provider's
              terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering
              practices, govern. You should conduct any investigation you feel
              necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction
              with any third party. Your transactions and other dealings with
              Third Party Ads that are found on or through the Website,

              solely between you and such merchant or advertiser. <br />4.8. You

              and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and
              property damage, that are either directly or indirectly related to
              or arise from any interactions with or conduct of any Service
              users, or any Third Party Ads.<br /><br />5. FEES AND PAYMENT<br />5.1.
              The Service allows users to purchase personalized learning courses
              either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a recurring
              interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2)
              pre-paying for access to the Service for a specific period
              (collectively referred to as "Purchase"). <br />5.2. To the
              fullest extent allowed by law, we reserve the right to change
              Purchase fees at any time. We will provide you with reasonable
              notice of any pricing changes by posting the new prices on the
              Service, sending you an email notification, or through other
              prominent means. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you may
              cancel the relevant subscription before the new rates take effect.
              <br />5.3. You authorize us to charge the applicable fees to the
              payment card you submit. <br />5.4. By subscribing to certain
              subscriptions, you agree that your subscription may automatically
              renew. Unless you cancel your subscription, you authorize us to
              charge you for the renewal term. The auto-renewal period will
              match your initial subscription period unless otherwise specified
              on the Service. The renewal rate will not exceed the rate for the
              previous subscription period, excluding any promotional and
              discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change before
              your auto-renewal. You must cancel your subscription according to
              the disclosed cancellation procedures for that specific
              subscription. We do not offer refunds for any fees that may have
              accrued to your account and do not prorate fees for canceled
              subscriptions. <br />5.5. We may offer a trial subscription to the
              Service, providing you access for a specified period, with details
              outlined when you sign up for the offer. Unless you cancel before
              the end of the trial, or unless stated otherwise, your access to
              the Service will continue automatically, and you will be billed
              the applicable fees. It is your responsibility to know when the
              trial ends. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to
              modify or terminate any trial offer, your access to the Service
              during the trial, or any of these terms without notice and without
              liability. We also reserve the right to limit your ability to take
              advantage of multiple trials. <br />5.6. Your rights to use the
              Service expire at the end of the paid period of your subscription.
              If you fail to pay the fees or charges due, we may make reasonable
              efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve
              the right to disable or terminate your access to the Service
              without notice. <br />5.7. Except as required by law, the Company
              does not provide refunds for any transactions once they have been
              made. By making a Purchase, you acknowledge and agree that all
              Purchases are non-refundable and non-exchangeable. <br />Note for
              EU residents: <br />If you are an EU user, you have the right to
              withdraw from the service agreement and agreement for digital
              content without charge and without giving any reason within
              fourteen (14) days from the date of the agreement's conclusion.
              The withdrawal right does not apply if the performance of the
              agreement has begun with your prior express consent and your
              acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal. YOU
              HEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE IMMEDIATE PERFORMANCE OF THE
              AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR RIGHT OF
              WITHDRAWAL FROM THE AGREEMENT ONCE OUR SERVERS VALIDATE YOUR
              PURCHASE AND THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE IS SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED TO
              YOU.<br /><br />6. DIGITAL CONTENT LICENSE<br />6.1. If you
              purchase Digital Content, we grant you a single-seat,

              Digital Content for personal, non-commercial purposes. <br />6.2.

              provide access to, share, or otherwise transfer any Digital

              trademark, logo, service mark, or other indication of origin; (iv)
              falsely represent that you created the Digital Content; (v) modify

              ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. THE COMPANY AND ITS
              AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT: (I) THE
              SERVICE, DIGITAL CONTENT, OR OTHER INFORMATION WILL BE TIMELY,

              CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE (AND OUR AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
              ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY INDIRECT,
              CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
              ARISING FROM THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE
              SERVICE (INCLUDING THE WEBSITE OR CONTENT), OR THIRD-PARTY ADS,
              EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
              ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICE (INCLUDING THE WEBSITE,
              CONTENT, AND USER CONTENT), AND THIRD-PARTY ADS ARE AT YOUR OWN
              DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
              DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTING SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING
              THEREFROM. <br />9.2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
              HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO YOU
              FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE WEBSITE,
              CONTENT, OR SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO THE
              COMPANY FOR THE SERVICE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH
              ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE TERMS BETWEEN
              THE COMPANY AND YOU. <br />9.3. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
              THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR
              CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY
              NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT
              VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.<br /><br />10.
              INDEMNITY<br />You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its
              successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies,
              suppliers, licensors, and partners, and the officers, directors,
              employees, agents, and representatives of each of them harmless,
              including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or demand made
              by any third party due to or arising out of (i) your use of the
              Service, (ii) your User Content, or (iii) your violation of these
              Terms. The Company reserves the right, at your expense, to assume
              the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are
              required to indemnify us and you agree to cooperate with our
              defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter
              without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company will
              use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or
              proceeding upon becoming aware of it.<br /><br />11. INTERNATIONAL
              USE<br />The Company makes no representation that the Service is
              accessible, appropriate, or legally available for use in your
              jurisdiction, and accessing and using the Service is prohibited
              from territories where doing so would be illegal. You access the
              Service at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance
              with local laws.<br /><br />12. MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND
              CLASS ACTION WAIVER<br />12.1. PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION
              PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE
              PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE IN THE
              FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL
              ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE
              RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU
              WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE
              MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. <br />12.2. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY
              ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
              PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
              CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE
              ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE
              PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
              <br />12.3. YOU AND THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH EACH OF ITS RESPECTIVE
              AGENTS, CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS
              IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS, AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT
              FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT) AS THE
              EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW,
              FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
              AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE, OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, UNLESS YOU ARE
              LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF
              ARBITRATION FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION.<br />12.4. Arbitration is a
              more informal way to settle disputes than a lawsuit in court. A
              neutral arbitrator, instead of a judge or jury, is used in
              arbitration, which allows for more limited discovery than in court
              and is subject to very limited review by courts. The same damages
              and relief that a court can award can be awarded by arbitrators.
              Please see more information about arbitration at
              <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>.<br />12.5. A
              party intending to seek arbitration must first send to the other a
              written notice of intent to arbitrate (a "Notice") by an
              international courier with a tracking mechanism, or, in the
              absence of a mailing address provided by you to us, via any other
              method available to us, including via email. The Notice to the
              Company must be addressed to: AMC - BOULEVARD-B BUILDING, Ajman
              Media City, United Arab Emirates (as applicable, the "Arbitration
              Notice Address"). The Notice shall (i) describe the basis and
              nature of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set the specific relief
              sought (the "Demand"). If you and the Company do not reach an
              agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is
              received, then you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding as
              set forth below or file an individual claim in small claims court.
              <br />12.6. THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") WILL
              EXCLUSIVELY ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS
              COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR
              CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES (THE "RULES"), AS MODIFIED BY THESE
              TERMS.<br />12.7. If you commence arbitration against us, you are
              required to provide a second Notice to the Company at the
              Arbitration Notice Address within seven (7) days of arbitration
              commencement. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at
              <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>. Unless your
              Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad
              faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of
              the filing fee, if you are required to pay a filing fee to
              commence an arbitration against us, then we will promptly
              reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon
              our receipt of the second Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address
              that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt
              evidencing payment of the filing fee.<br />12.8. The arbitration
              shall be conducted exclusively in English. A single, independent,
              and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business
              in Alexandria, Virginia (if you are from the United States) or in
              Ajman, United Arab Emirates (if you are not from the United
              States) will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified
              herein. You and the Company agree to comply with the following
              rules, which are intended to streamline the arbitration process
              and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the
              arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on
              written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party
              initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require
              any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless
              otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any
              judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any
              court of competent jurisdiction.<br /><br />13. GOVERNING LAW<br />13.1.
              These Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by the
              laws of the United Arab Emirates, excluding its conflict of law
              principles. <br />13.2. To the extent that any action related to a
              dispute under these Terms is permitted to be brought in a court of
              law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of:
              <br />13.2.1. The state and federal courts located in the City of
              Alexandria, Virginia, if you are a resident of the United States;
              or <br />13.2.2. The courts of Ajman, United Arab Emirates, if you
              are not a resident of the United States; <br />and you hereby
              irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction and venue in such
              courts, waiving any defense of improper venue or inconvenient
              forum.<br /><br />14. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS<br />14.1. No delay
              or omission by us in exercising any of our rights upon any
              noncompliance or default by you regarding these Terms will impair
              any such right or be construed as a waiver thereof, and a waiver
              by the Company of any of the covenants, conditions, or agreements
              to be performed by you will not be construed as a waiver of any
              succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition, or
              agreement contained herein. <br />14.2. Subject to Section 12, if
              any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or
              unenforceable, the remaining Terms will remain in full force and
              effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while
              reflecting the parties' intent to the greatest extent permitted by
              law. <br />14.3. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
              these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the
              Company regarding their subject matter and supersede all prior
              promises, agreements, or representations, whether written or oral,
              regarding such subject matter. <br />14.4. The Company may
              transfer or assign any and all of its rights and obligations under
              these Terms to any other person, by any means, including by
              novation, and by accepting these Terms, you consent to any such
              assignment and transfer. You confirm that placing a version of
              these Terms on the Service indicating another person as a party to
              the Terms shall constitute valid notice to you of the transfer of
              the Company's rights and obligations under the Agreement (unless
              otherwise expressly indicated). <br />14.5. All information
              communicated on the Service is considered an electronic
              communication. When you communicate with us through or on the
              Service or via other forms of electronic media, such as email, you
              are communicating with us electronically. You agree that we may
              communicate electronically with you and that such communications,
              as well as notices, disclosures, agreements, and other
              communications that we provide to you electronically, are
              equivalent to communications in writing and shall have the same
              force and effect as if they were in writing and signed by the
              party sending the communication. You further acknowledge and agree
              that by clicking on a button labeled "SUBMIT", "CONTINUE", "ADD TO
              CART", "PAY", or similar links or buttons, you are submitting a
              legally binding electronic signature and are entering into a
              legally binding contract. You acknowledge that your electronic
              submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by
              these Terms. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES,
              CONTRACTS, ORDERS, AND OTHER RECORDS AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF
              NOTICES, POLICIES, AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR
              COMPLETED THROUGH THE SERVICE. <br />14.6. In no event shall the
              Company be liable for any failure to comply with these Terms to
              the extent that such failure arises from factors outside the
              Company's reasonable control.<br /><br />15. CONTACT<br />If you
              need to send any notice under these Terms or have any questions
