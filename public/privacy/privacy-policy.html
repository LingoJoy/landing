              <br />
              We use Hotjar, a behavior analytics tool, to analyze Service use,
              providing feedback through tools such as heatmaps, session
              recordings, and surveys. For more details, refer to Hotjar’s

              3.6 To send you marketing communications<br />
              We process your personal data for our marketing campaigns. As a
              result, you will receive information about our products, such as
              special offers or new features available on the Service. We may
              show you advertisements on our Service and send you marketing
              emails. If you do not wish to receive marketing emails, you can
              unsubscribe by following the instructions in the footer of such
              emails.

              For marketing communications, we use Iterable, a cross-channel
              marketing platform that allows us to send you in-app messages,
              push notifications, and emails. Refer to Iterable's Privacy Policy

              <br />
              3.7 To personalize our ads<br />
              We and our partners use your personal data to tailor ads and
              potentially show them to you at relevant times. For example, if
              you visited our Website or installed the App, you might see ads
              for our products in your Facebook feed.

              altogether by changing your browser’s cookie settings. These
              settings are usually found in the “options” or “preferences” menu

              and prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics.
              <br />
              We value your right to control the ads you see. Below is a list of
              service providers we use for this purpose and how some of them
              allow you to control your ad preferences.
              <br />
              We use Facebook pixel on the Service. The Facebook pixel is a code
              placed on the Service that collects data to help us track
              conversions from Facebook ads, build targeted audiences, and
              remarket to people who have interacted with the Service (e.g.,
              made a purchase).
              <br />
              We use Facebook Ads Manager to create and manage our Facebook ads.
              This tool lets us view, modify, and see results for all our
              Facebook campaigns, ad sets, and ads. Facebook users can control
              the types of ads they see on Facebook by adjusting their
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences">ad settings</a
              >.
              <br />
              We use Facebook Audience Network SDK, an in-app advertising
              network for mobile apps, to monetize our App by displaying
              targeted ads that match user interests.
              <br />
              Google Ads is an ad delivery service provided by Google that
              tailors ads to users who have performed certain actions on our
              Service (e.g., showing ads to users who have made a purchase). For
              more information, users can opt-out of personalized ads and
              prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics.
              <br />
              We use Google AdMob, a mobile advertising platform, to generate
              revenue from our App by displaying ads in various formats.
              <br />
              3.8 To process your payments<br />
              We offer paid products and/or services within the Service and use
              third-party services for payment processing (e.g., payment
              processors). As a result, you can make a payment, and we will be
              notified that the payment has been made. We do not store or
              collect your payment card details; this information is provided
              directly to our third-party payment processors. For payment
              processing, we use Stripe, a payment processing provider. We also
              use Solid, a payment gateway provider. For payments, we may
              propose using PayPal.
              <br />
              3.9 To enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use and to prevent and
              combat fraud<br />
              We use personal data to enforce our agreements and contractual
              commitments and to detect, prevent, and combat fraud. As a result,
              we may share your information with others, including law
              enforcement agencies, if a dispute arises in connection with our
              Terms and Conditions of Use.
              <br />
              3.10 To comply with legal obligations<br />
              We may process, use, or share your data when required by law,
              particularly if requested by a law enforcement agency through
              available legal means.
              <br /><br />4. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
              <br />

              and freedoms requiring protection of personal data <br />We rely
              on legitimate interests to: <br />- Communicate with you regarding
              your use of our Service, such as sending emails or push

              encouraging you to use our Service more frequently. <br />-
              Research and analyze your use of the Service, to improve our
              Service based on user preferences and feedback, making it more
              enjoyable and introducing new features. Our legitimate interest is
              to enhance the user experience. <br />- Send you marketing

              WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
              <br />
              We share information with third parties that help us operate,
              provide, improve, integrate, customize, support, and market our
              Service. Specifically, we may share certain sets of personal data
              for the purposes and with the parties indicated in Section 3 of
              this Privacy Policy. The types of third parties we share
              information with include:
              <br />
              5.1 Service providers
              <br />
              <br />We share personal data with third parties hired to provide
              services or perform business functions on our behalf, based on our
              instructions. These service providers include: <br />- Cloud
              storage providers (e.g., Amazon, Firestorage) <br />- Data
              analytics providers (e.g., Facebook, Firebase, Appsflyer,

              Solid)
              <br />
              5.2 Law enforcement agencies and other public authorities
              <br />
              We may use and disclose personal data to enforce our Terms and

              5.3 Third parties as part of a merger or acquisition
              <br />
              As we grow our business, we may buy or sell assets or business
              offerings. Customer information is typically one of the
              transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may
              also share such information with any affiliated entity (e.g.,
              parent company or subsidiary) and may transfer such information
              during a corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business,
              a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the
              unlikely event of bankruptcy.
              <br /><br />
              6. HOW YOU CAN EXERCISE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
              <br />
              To manage your personal data, you have the following rights:
              <br />
              Accessing / reviewing / updating / correcting your personal data:
              You may review, edit, or change the personal data you have
              previously provided on the Service.
              <br />
              Deleting your personal data: You can request the deletion of your
              personal data as permitted by law. When you request deletion, we
              will use reasonable efforts to honor your request. In some cases,
              we may be legally required to retain some data for a specific
              period; in such instances, we will fulfill your request after
              complying with our obligations.
              <br />
              Objecting to or restricting the use of your personal data: You can
              ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data or limit
              our use of it.
              <br />
              Additional information for EEA-based users:
              <br />
              If you are based in the EEA, you have the following additional
              rights:
              <br />
              The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: While
              we would prefer you to contact us directly to address your
              concerns, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent
              data protection supervisory authority, particularly in the EU
              Member State where you reside, work, or where the alleged
              infringement occurred.
              <br />
              The right to data portability: If you wish to receive your
              personal data in a machine-readable format, you can send a request
              to us as described below.
              <br />
              To exercise any of your privacy rights, please send a request to

              <a
                href="mailto:work@appmediaco.com"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="mail_link"
                >work@appmediaco.com</a
              >. <br /><br />
              7. AGE LIMITATION
              <br />
              We do not knowingly process personal data from persons under 16
              years of age. If you learn that someone under 16 has provided us
              with personal data, please contact us.
              <br /><br />
              8. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
              <br />
              We may transfer personal data to countries other than the one in
              which the data was originally collected to provide the Service as
              outlined in the Terms and Conditions of Use and for the purposes
              indicated in this Privacy Policy. If these countries do not have
              the same data protection laws as your home country, we deploy
              special safeguards.
              <br />
              Specifically, if we transfer personal data from the EEA to
              countries with inadequate levels of data protection, we use one of
              the following legal bases: (i) Standard Contractual Clauses
              approved by the European Commission (<a
                href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en"
                >details available</a
              >
              ), or (ii) the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about
              certain countries (<a
                href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en"
                >details available</a
              >). <br /><br />
              9. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
              <br />
              We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide
              to make material changes, you will be notified by available means
              such as email, and you will have an opportunity to review the
              revised Privacy Policy. By continuing to access or use the Service
              after these changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the
              revised Privacy Policy.
              <br /><br />
              10. DATA RETENTION
              <br />
              We will store your personal data for as long as reasonably
              necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy
              (including providing the Service to you). We will also retain and
              use your personal data as necessary to comply with our legal
              obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
              <br /><br />
              11. HOW “DO NOT TRACK” REQUESTS ARE HANDLED
              <br />
              Various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
              Safari) offer a DNT option that relies on a technology known as a
              DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the
              browser user about the user's DNT preference. You can usually
              access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences.
              <br />
              We currently do not support “Do Not Track” requests because no DNT
              standard has been adopted.
              <br />
              Our third-party services may collect information about you and
              your online activities over time and across our Services and other
              online properties. These third parties may not change their
              tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web
              browser, and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT
              settings. To determine whether any of the third-party services
              honor the “Do Not Track” requests, please read their privacy
              policies.
